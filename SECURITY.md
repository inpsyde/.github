As a WordPress agency, Syde works with all sorts of clients who need our software to be reliable and safe, protecting sensitive and business-critical information. 
We believe that before anything else, our software solutions should be secure.  
Still, there's a chance that we missed something. 

**If you have found a vulnerability in one of Syde's repositories on GitHub, please send an email to code-security@syde.com.  
Do _not_ open an issue to disclose information about the vulnerability, since issues are immediately publicly visible after creation.**

We will respond as soon as possible and will keep you updated as we resolve the issue.
